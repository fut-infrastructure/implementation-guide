### GOTCHA's
Dont use `/`'s in the branch name as those branches will never be built by the HL7 CI pipeline.

The CI/CD pipeline uses the HL7 CI/CD infrastructure and Github webhooks which is documented here https://github.com/FHIR/auto-ig-builder

## Local development

### Running locally
Do `rm -rf output && rm -rf temp/ && ./_genonce.sh`

### See the result locally
Do `docker run -p 80:80 -v $(pwd)/output:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx`

### Combined
Do `rm -rf output && rm -rf temp/ && ./_genonce.sh && docker run -p 80:80 -v $(pwd)/output:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx`

# Formal publications
The Implementation Guide Publisher (IGP for short) makes a set of assumptions that any formal publications needs to adhere to ([directory structure](https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=81027536#MaintainingaFHIRIGPublication-DirectoryStructure(), [general](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/IG+Publication+Request+Documentation) and [publication-request](https://github.com/fut-infrastructure/implementation-guide/blob/master/publication-request.json) the file). 

The process is best documented in the docker image [here](https://github.com/trifork/ig-publisher).

Execution takes a couple of minutes. Once done, the content of the `$(pwd)/fut-ig-website` must be committed and pushed to the origin. Now your publication is done.

## Publication trigger rules

See [here](./RELEASE.md).

## General (FUT) development guidelines

### Add a introduction to a profile
It is possible to write an introduction to a profile by following these steps:
1. Create a markdown file in `/input/intro-notes/` folder with the name StructureDefinition-ehealth-*-intro.md where * is the name of the resource (eg. StructureDefinition-ehealth-activitydefinition-intro.md). The content of the file should be the introduction.

### Update documentation on event messages
Event messages are documented in the markdown file `/input/pagecontent/event-messages.md`. It is displayed in the `Operations and Search Parameters` tab. The file is generated from the hapi-fhir-base project, and if changes are done to the package `com.systematic.ehealth.events`, then the documentation may need to be updated. 
1. In the hapi-fhir-base project, run the test GenerateEventsForIGTest.
2. Locate the file `eventmessages.md` in the root of the hapi-fhir-base project.
3. Copy the file to `/input/pagecontent/event-messages.md` in the implementationguide project.
