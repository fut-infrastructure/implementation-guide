    "description": "This operation is used to lookup a citizen. It first attempts lookup on the service and, if a match is found, returns a Person resource with name, identifier, deceased-status and a link to the Patient resource. If not, it proceeds to find prior CPR-numbers in the national infrastructure and checks if any of those match a patient on the service. If a match is found, it returns the same information, but with the identifier replaced with the query identifier. If no match is found, it finds base information on the national infrastructure and returns a 'limited' Person resource containing only the identifier, name and deceased-state of the person. The operation is an implementation of [https://www.hl7.org/fhir/stu3/patient-operations.html#match](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/stu3/patient-operations.html#match) on the Person resource.",
