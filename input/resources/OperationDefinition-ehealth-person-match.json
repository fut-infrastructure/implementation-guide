    "description": "This operation is used to lookup a citizen. It first attempts lookup on the service and, if a match is found, returns a Person resource with name, identifier, deceased-status and a link to the Patient resource. If not, it proceeds to find any prior CPR-numbers associated with the query CPR in the national infrastructure and checks if any of those match a patient on the service. If a match is found, it returns a Person resource with the same information, but with the identifier replaced with the query identifier. If no match is found, it finds base information on the national infrastructure and returns a 'limited' Person resource containing only the identifier, name and deceased-state of the person. The operation is an implementation of [https://www.hl7.org/fhir/stu3/patient-operations.html#match](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/stu3/patient-operations.html#match) on the Person resource.",
