  "description": "Operation for polling the status of a previously initiated FHIR Bulk Data System Level Export. A complete URL including the '_jobId' is returned in the 'Content-Location' response header when initiating the export. A 'GET' request to the polling location will return '202 Accepted' with a response header 'X-Progress' containing a status message for the progress of the export job. When the job has finished, the polling location will return '200 OK', and the contents of the body will be a JSON object providing metadata and links to the generated bulk data files. A 'DELETE' request can be used to cancel the export. If the export has already finished, the delete will return '404 Not Found', else the export job will be cancelled and a '202 Accepted' is returned with an operation outcome response.\n### Parameters\n- _jobId: the job ID for the Bulk Export job which was returned in the 'Content-Location' header when initiating the export\n",
