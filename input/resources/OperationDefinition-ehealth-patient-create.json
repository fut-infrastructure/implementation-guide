    "description": "Creates a Patient resource on the server and returns it in the response. If the patient already exists, it is returned instead. If the CPR number does not match a patient on the service, looks up the CPR in the national registry and finds any potential prior CPRs used by the person. If a prior CPR number matches a patient on the service, updates the patient with national data, and returns a patient with the newest data. NOTE: This means that the returned patient can have a different identifier than the one used for the request. If no prior CPR matches, creates a new patient using national data. If the CPR is invalid, i.e. does not correspond to a patient on the national registry, it errors. \r\n\r\n### Note\r\nThis operation is currently the only way to create Patient resources in the eHealth Infrastructure, as it ensures that the correct bindings from national registers",
