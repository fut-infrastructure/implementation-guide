  "description": "The submit-measurement operation provides a single measurement in the form of a Bundle of Observation, QuestionnaireResponse and Media for storage and, subsequently, further processing in the eHealth Infrastructure. A Provenance resource is implicitly created by the infrastructure referencing input Bundle resources as target, thereby relating the resources that were submitted. \n\n\n### Parameter description\nmeasurement: Bundle containing:\n- 0..* Observation (ehealth-observation profile)\n- 0..* QuestionnaireResponse (ehealth-questionnaireresponse profile)\n- 0..* Media (ehealth-media profile)\n- 0..* Provenance (ehealth-provenance profile). Each Provenance (which is intended for capturing reuse of measurement(s) â€“ as described in the eHealth Observation profile introduction) must refer to other resources in the Bundle as target in the format \"urn:oid:<the oid>\" or \"urn:uuid:<the uuid>.\".\n\nAll resources in the Bundle must refer to the same Patient and EpisodeOfCare.\nAll resources in the Bundle as well as the created Provenance will receive any missing system tags (ehealth-system CodeSystem) provided by the referenced EpisodeOfCare.\nThe request will be denied if any resource in the Bundle contains a system tag, which is not present on the referenced EpisodeOfCare\n\n\n### Output description\nThe returned Bundle contains references to the stored input resources where the id has been substituted.\n\neHealth infrastructure will substitute the id when saving the resources in a single transaction.",
