# Introduction
An Action guidance expresses a set of instructions to a clinician/employee in a given situation.

# Scope and Usage
The action guidance can be associated with one or more Questionnaires, which is why it is based on questions and answers. That is, which questions and answers in an associated Questionnaire should give rise to the presentation of instructions to the clinician/employee.

The profile is based on the native FHIR Basic resource and adds the following extensions:
* `ehealth-content` The element used for the actual modeling of action guidance.
* `ehealth-basic-title` Name for this action guidance.
* `ehealth-description` A description of this action guidance.
* `ehealth-purpose` Why this action definition is defined.
* `ehealth-version` The business version of the action guidance.
* `ehealth-useContext` The context that the content is intended to support.
* `ehealth-recommendation` The recommendation level of this action guidance.
* `ehealth-intendedAudience` Can be set to one or more Organizations to indicate for which Organization(s) this action guidance is intended to be used by. This is meant for filtering and is not enforced or in any way restricting which Organization has access.
* `ehealth-actionguidance-type` Type of action guidance.
* `ehealth-actionguidance-for` A reference to a resource for which this action guidance applies.

## Update restrictions
The element `ehealth-modifier-role` specifies one or more Organization and each Organization's role in maintaining
the Action guidance:

* `ehealth-modifier-role.reference` references the Organization.
* `ehealth-modifier-role.role` set to `owner` means that the referenced Organization can update the resource
  and alter the entities referenced by `ehealth-modifier-role`, for instance, by adding more co-authors.
* `ehealth-modifier-role.role` set to `co-author` means that the referenced Organization can update the resource
  but not alter the element `ehealth-modifier-role`.

## Lifecycle
The status field,`ehealth-status`, will express the lifecycle of the resource. Changes follow this pattern.
  - When created it will have status `draft`.
  - From status `draft` can change to either `active` or `retired`.
  - From status `active` can only change to `retired`.
