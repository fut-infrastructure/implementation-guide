Some activities may involve answering a Questionnaire. The answer is captured in a QuestionnaireResponse. Questionnaires can be used for standalone information about the health of the patient, or they can be used to provide context information for Observations. 

It is possible to search for QuestionnaireResponses based on:
* context 
* subject
* code
* period
* deviceMeasuringQuality
* situationQuality
* operationQuality

At least one of "subject" and "context" must be provided. "period" searches on range of "authored".
